Let me breakdown this timeline for how I came to want to study data science (with Flatiron).

### Background Mentality:

When I think data, I think of enumerating information that you can derive reports from. The most straightforward category of notations is mathematics. This “linear philosophy” has always clicked with me growing up. My curiosity to calculate exact solutions (or closest approximations) kept me intrigued in how to come about the answer in the most efficient way possible. I need to apply my critical thinking to where sometimes it is not obvious in how to acquire an answer as there may be several ways to it.

When I think science, I think of an anonymous quote: “If the work is truly experimental then the results should be observed, not altered.” It captures my interest in the reverse way as math does. I do not particularly need to know if the results are correct, but instead I need to be able to justify why I got said observations, honing my communication abilities so the average layman can grasp the theory behind the experiment. 

The sense of belonging and giving back to the community are mantras that replenished my overall well-being. I enjoy using my strengths to help people whenever I can; I never want to leave anyone behind. It is this passion that keeps me driven to improve myself so I can adapt to whatever situation I am in and adopt to providing support, whether it be directly or indirectly.

### College Years’ Trial And Error:

Therefore, it made sense to me to study in the field revolving around healthcare. I bounced around several undergraduate majors never truly identifying with a niche I was comfortable with. That was until I was required to take Biostatistics. It is a difficult subject, but my professor taught me in a way that was so natural to comprehend. And after the semester, he encouraged me to join his research lab, then inspired me to switch my major to Statistics. And that’s where the fun began.

I found delight in several courses that taught basic programming languages that translated similarly throughout the platforms. But I was always most eager about Microsoft Excel, especially when I realized that formulas and shortcuts could build amazing spreadsheets. In my research lab I had to be *meticulous* about my data, yet *creative* in my analysis (my inspiration for my blog name). The appeal to learning Excel included that your interpretations did not even have to be math related- conditional formatting can transform your worksheet colorfully and appeases to the eye at a quick glance. If you can think of it, more than likely, there is a way to implement it. So, I sought out for ways to enhance my facts and figures. I even actively subscribed to email tips from several different experts. I am constantly in awe with discovering all that it has to offer, and it is a gratifying relief when you can get it to work (programming humor). I am always proud to show off my custom-made sheets. I have always wanted to do more, but lack of practice and accountability after graduating Spring of 2016 faltered me from doing so.

### Post-Graduation Uncertainty:

With my degree in Statistics, I felt (and was) alone in my studies. I attempted my shot at becoming an Actuary. But as months lapsed further after graduation, I was becoming more discouraged with three failed attempts at the first test (out of 5+ more depending on specialty). After several deliberations with close friends and family (and ultimately myself), I accepted that this career was not for me. But I was still determined to persevere in finding something where I could utilize my degree and still be enthusiastic about it.

I was in a limbo phase after college not knowing what was to come next but occupy my time working as a wellness coordinator and purchaser for a small company (I still hold this position today). In the office, being the youngest and most technologically adept worker, I automated a lot of outdated practices, helping them launch into the modern, digital world. And while not at work, I spent a lot of time undertaking new adventures being outdoors (thankfully, my employer was flexible with this hobby of mine). This schedule allowed me to enjoy the balance between personal and work life. But even as I was giving more responsibilities, I knew there was not much advancement in the company that could also sustain my lifestyle.

### Success With Flatiron!

I wanted to strive for a new and lucrative goal that allowed for career stability and growth. Because I enjoy travelling, I entertained the idea of being remote or being my own boss as a motivator. After appreciating the formula and shortcut skills I have been revisiting and picking up again from my company’s projects (mainly Google Sheets, which is not as powerful as Excel, but with their scripts editor function, they are becoming a much worthy adversary), I knew I wanted to know more about coding.

Unlike my actuarial studies, I did not want to do this alone. And that’s where this school came in. When doing my research about coding, Flatiron right from the start emphasized their support system that helps them all thrive. And after being increasingly lured in with the possible concepts that their Boot Camp Prep course introduced, it was an indisputable decision to follow this ambition.

Every year I design a challenging and purposeful pursuit to better my life in the long run. Enrolling in February 2019’s part-time cohort of 10 months could not have been more perfect. And when the year is over, Data Scientist rolls off the tongue nicely, doesn’t it?
